# pythons-on-a-plane

This is the code for our team project created as a part of the Code First Girls Python course.
We  collectively choose to produce a python movie search app which allows users to search themoviedb api for any query and returns all movies containing that query then allows users to select a specific movie, gain all information regarding that movie and prints it to a text file

We started with a basic movie search query then extended this to return more information about the movie and then to write to a text file. 

## What was our process?

We discussed an initial plan for the project and produced a collective MOSCOW method list of requirements. 
MUST:
ability to search for a movie using the IMDb API (or alternative) and display basic information about the movie.
SHOULD:
allow user to search for movies by different criteria such as genre, actors, ratings.
COULD:
allow user to add movie to to watchlist file.
WONT:
have a facility to rent/purchase/stream movie


We then produced a basic movie search which returned a list of movies containing the initial query. 

Each person in the team added to the code improving the code with a new feature each time. 


## What is the course about?

Code first girls run free coding for women in the UK aiming to reduce the gender diversity gap in the tech industry. They've taught *80,000* women to code so far!

This was an 8 week course that taught all of the fundamentals of Python and App development. We completed individual learning and exercises throughout the weeks and a final team project - this is ours!



## What did we learn?

- Python
- Google
- Collaboration with Github
